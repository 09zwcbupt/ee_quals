# Past Exams
This directory contains past exams, sorted various ways. Past exams by year are provided by Stanford. Past professors by prof contains most professor's questions back to 2006 across the board. HOwever, only a few of them go back beyond 2006. These were just compiled by hand by splitting each year's exam questions and manually sorting. So, feel free to add more past years, correct mistakes, etc.

For convenience in adding or correcting things, by-prof-src contains the individual pages that were joined to create by-prof PDFs.

One popular method of splitting and joining PDFs is PDFTK Portable.
