A repository for notes and other study resources for the Stanford Electrical
Engineering qualification exam.

## Past Exams
An archive of PDFs of quals questions from past years, provided by Stanford.
Note that the ```past-exams/by-prof-src/``` folder contains the pages that were split from
the exams-by-year PDFs and joined. These are provided to make adding later
questions easier.

## Solutions
A collection of solutions and clarification points for questions that we worked. As well as some general study notes.

## General Strategies

### Choosing Professors
The standard instructions have not changed. You select 20 professors and get 4 from the first group, 3 from the second, 2 from the third, and 1 from the last. You are also told that you will not get more than 4 professors from the same quals area.

Exploiting these rules, one trick is to put five professors from the same area in your first group. You will get four of these five. The sixth professor from the same area can be completely eliminated by placing him or her in your second group, since you can't get more than 4 from one area. This means you'll get 3 of 4 professors in your 2nd group instead of 3 of 5. You can propagate this idea.
